### What I learnt

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I made the mistake of starting with the desktop design, which meant I had to then work my way down. I didn't do it on purpose, it was more absent-mindedness on my part. I do prefer the mobile-first approach but because of how backwards the dev process is in my current job, that's how most of the websites are built. Too much importance is places on desktop when that isn't even the most common device for most websites. So because of this, when we are given websites to build, we always get desktop designs only. So this is a very bad habit that I am _desperately_ trying to break.
